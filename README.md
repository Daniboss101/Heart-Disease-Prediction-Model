# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that explores different machine learning models (Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression) to predict the likelihood of heart disease.

## Contents
â€“ Data cleaning
- EDA
- Model training
- Evaluation and Results.

## Key Findings
- Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy (98%) and strong precision/recall balance.
- Decision Tree also performed well (95% accuracy).
- Logistic Regression was moderate (75% accuracy).
- Arterial health features (e.g., number of major vessels, `laddist`) were the most important predictors.

## Note
All explanations, graphs, and results are inside the notebook itself.
